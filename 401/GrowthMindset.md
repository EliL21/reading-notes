## How Topic Relates to me 

- We're all self-taught in this business. The only person who understands your skillset well enough to teach you is you. What challenges can you set yourself that meet these criteria?

The challenges have to push you just outside your comfort zone. It's no use trying to solve a complex problem in code if you can't yet iterate over an array. The gap in your knowledge that the challenge forces you to overcome needs to be surmountable. 

  I personally can identify with this statement, in the classroom enviornment I struggle grasping concepts and often find myself behind. I have the growth mindset going for me at best I feel. As I continue to push and progress I find myslef learning new things and new ways to learn. I look to find a way that I can push myself more and understand things for my personal growth and understanding.
