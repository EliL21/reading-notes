# Notes Class 4

## Learn HTML

1. To create a basic link we wrap the <a> elment and reference the image file with <img> element.
2. The href attribute also known as Hypertext Reference or target contains the web address.
3. We can ensure links on our page is accessible to all users by doing the following:Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text — URLs look ugly, and sound even uglier when a screen reader reads them out letter by letter.
Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text — it's just noise. Screen readers tell people there's a link. Visual users will also know there's a link, because links are generally styled in a different color and underlined (this convention generally shouldn't be broken, as users are used to it).
Keep your link text as short as possible — this is helpful because screen readers need to interpret the entire link text.
Minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places. This can cause problems for screen reader users, if there's a list of links out of context that are labeled "click here", "click here", "click here".
