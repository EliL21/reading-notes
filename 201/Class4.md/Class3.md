1. Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties. Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.
2. Some HTML elements, such as <h1> and <p>, use block as their outer display type by default.
If a box has an outer display type of block, then:

The box will break onto a new line.
The width and height properties are respected.
Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box.
The box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container. In most cases, the box will become as wide as its container, filling up 100% of the space available.
A paragraph with a border added in CSS. The browser renders this as a block box. The paragraph starts on a new line and extends the entire available width.
A list, which is laid out using display: flex. This establishes flex layout for the children of the container, which are flex items. The list itself is a block box and — like the paragraph — expands to the full container width and breaks onto a new line.
A block-level paragraph, inside which are two <span> elements. These elements would normally be inline, however, one of the elements has a class of "block" which gets set to display: block.
